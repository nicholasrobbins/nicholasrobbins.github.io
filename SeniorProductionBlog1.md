The Beginning of Senior Production - What it Means to be a Lead
------
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Starting this semester I have gained two new programmers onto my team, while also taking up the mantle of lead programmer. Being a lead programmer is a new concept for me as I have never had to take a leadership role in my discipline before so it will be a learning curve until I become fully comfortable with my position. However, even though I do not have previous expereience beaing a programming lead, I still have ideas for what I can do, and what I want to do as a lead.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that every lead should take the inititive to make everyone of its members feel comfortable and happy with the team and the work that they are working on. One of my main concerns about bringing on the new programmers is making sure that they are content with the work that they are doing so that they have the best senior production semester possible and that in the end they are satisfied and feel accomplished with the work they did. I had an experience with a previous production class where we got a 2D artist onto our game, and though it was true that we did need UI art for menus and in-game, I felt like we did not ask from them the extent of their abilities and they were left with not much to do. I do not want to see that same mistake happen again with any of the programmers on my team and I will work with them and with the other leads to make sure that everyone's skills are being utilized completely.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next attribute that I think a lead needs to have is the willingness to always be flexible and availible for what the team needs. An example of this would be willing to go help one of the programmers with something, even if I at that exact moment I was playing a game. The individuals on the team come before fun and play. If some members are going to be working somewhere, then it is also important for me to be there so I can help them and answer any questions that they may have.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I want to make sure that every member of the team is happy with being on the team and with the game that they are making. I know that this is overall a producer's job to handle the overall team, but I think that a lead should keep an eye close on their own group while keeping a general watch of the rest of the members. One of the members on the team this semester is someone who I have never met before, and I don't think anyone has either. As a result they may feel alienated from the rest of the team because of the connections that are already built between us. It will be important to me that they will be happy with the group and working this semester on the game.
