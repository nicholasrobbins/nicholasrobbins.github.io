## **Arachnotron - Champlain College Senior Production**
**Solo 3rd Person Shooter**  |  **(Unity 2018, C#)**  |  **Team Size: 13**  |  **2018 - 2019** 

Arachnotron is a 3rd person shooter where the player takes control of a robot spider tank to fight against enemy robot bugs from the enemy faction S.W.A.R.M. In this game, the player has the capability to walk on any surface of the environment allowing new dimensions of gameplay to occur that is not traditional within the shooter genere. 

Most of my work consisted of AI implementation of the small enemies and the final boss, and backend systems which includes AI systems which allowed the enemies to deal with the complete three-dimensional movement of the player. Other work that I did included the inverse kinematics of the spider legs on the tank itself, which was used to make the spider feel a lot more realistic to the player while also reducing tremendous amount of work off of our artist.

### **[Multiple Award Winner](https://nicholasrobbins.github.io/RvPunchAwards)**
   
Players punch their opponents out of their way in this up to four player racing game, where they race as different model RVs equppied with giant mech fists. These fists act as the game's main mechanic which can be used to punch other racers off the track or stun them, activate or break objects within the racetrack environment, and even "jump" off the walls by punching them. 

Project made within Champlain College's Production 2 course.

## **Opportunity Knocks - Global Game Jam 2018**
**Adventure**  |  **(Unity 2017, C#)**  |  **Team Size: 4**  |  **2018** 

This game's main mechanic inspired by the jam's theme of "transmission" has the player control the mars rover as it moves across the surface of the planet, but because of the weak connection between the player and the rover, the signal that you transmit to it is laggy. By making lag a central game mechanic, the player must be careful by not driving the rover down a cliffside and make it to the end of each level. The player may choose to "boost" the signal to reduce the lag, at the cost of using up more energy.

## **Tile-Fall - (Unity 5, C#)**
**PvP Strategy Game**  |  **(Unity 2017, C#)**  |  **Team Size: 4**  |  **2017** 

Tile-Fall can best be described as "Battleship, but you see the other player." Each player inputs their movement decisions at the same time and then guesses which spot the player moved to. After all these decisions are made, the game resolves and the players move to their chosen spots and fire upon the spot that they chose. If a player is hit, the player that predicted the position wins, otherwise the tile hit is destroyed and the player on that side cannot move onto it.

## **Zelda Dungeon Recreation - (C++)** 
**Dungeon Crawler**  |  **C++**  |  **Team Size: 2**  |  **2017** 

A recreation of the first dungeon of Zelda using only C++ and Allegro for the final project of Champlain College's Game Architecture course. Working alongside [Matthew Roy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-roy-4ba050154/), we implemented multiple different gaming patterns including a component system and a defined game loop.
