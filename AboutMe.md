# Hello!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My name is Nicholas Robbins and I'm an indie game devloper. With the friends I made at Champlain College, we've formed MilkShed Games, a company that makes games that we want to make. As a native Vermonter, I want to see the growth of the games industry within it as I think the state has the potential to become a new center for gaming. Though I did not foresee that I was going to go indie out of college, I am excited for the path I have chosen, and cannot wait to see what the future has in store for me.
