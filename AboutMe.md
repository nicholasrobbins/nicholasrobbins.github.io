# Hello!

My name is Nicholas Robbins and I'm a game programmer and an alum from Burlington Vermont's Champlain College class of 2019. I enjoy programming background architecture and tools. After college my friends and I started our own Indie game Studio MilkShed Games based in Vermont. After two years together and a heartfelt attempt to kickstart our game, we decided to part ways and now I am an independent programmer looking for new work.
