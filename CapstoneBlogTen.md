First Semester Post Mortem
------

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;





&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This last bit may be going back a little far back, but I find it to be very important to me. When I came to the college, I had no previous programming experience, and I did not know whether or not programming or specifically game programming would be the right choice for me. Throughout my college career, I have been surrounded by very talented programmers and I had always tried to compare myself to their level as that's where I thought I needed to be. As a result, I have dealt with a good amount of imposter syndrome over the years, which sometimes has caused me to question myself and my skills in this major. Even though I have done well in my classes, I hadn't felt a true sense of validation for my skills. For production 2, I was very happy with how my game RV Punch turned out, especially with it getting multiple awards, but at the same time I still didn't feel completely validated because I thought that the other talented members of the team were carrying me. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Arachnotron feels different. This game is the first time that I feel completely validated as a game programmer and proves to myself that I am in the right major moving towards the career that I will enjoy. Despite the AI that I programmed in the game being somewhat rudimentary, it was the very first time I had programmed AI in a game, and the results proves my capacity to learn and execute different subjects that I may not be familiar with. This gives me hope that this means when I get into the industry itself, I will have the capacity to be able to learn the new skills they give me, and be able to execute with these skills for the development of the game that I work on. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It isn't only my work that makes me feel satisfied with myslef and the game because my peers have helped give me this sense of validation too. During the course of the game, I kept getting complements about how amazing the game and how fun it was. I would be told that it is one of the favorites of the first year students, and that it was considered to be the most fun game that they had played out of the capstone games. I was also being told contantly that the game was guaranteed to go through to the next semester with no problems, and lots of other programmers expressed their interest to work on the game if their game were to be cut. Finally, what really stuck it to me was the thunderous applause the game got when we were called to present during presentation night from the crowd, and when we finished. All this is not to be intended to be bragging, because all these kind complements that were being given to me and the game meant a lot to me as an individual who had not felt completely confident with himself. If it were not for all of these kind words, I may not feel as satisfied with my work right now. But today, I can look at my work and think about what has been said to me and think, "I did that."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next semester's goals are clear to me. 


Notes:

Ending: Talk about the confidence gained by the project and the sense of validation that the project has. Talk about the possible fear surrounding being a team lead programmer, and how I will be preparing for the workforce for the next semester.
