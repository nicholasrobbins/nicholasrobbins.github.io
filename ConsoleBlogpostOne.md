First Semester Post Mortem

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My plan is to create a built-in unity tool which allows the user to easily set up data gathering to then process them through data analytics. I want the system to be flexable to keep track of many different types of variables such as individual values, game events, the time it takes the player to exit a room or defeat an enemy, and positional data of where players tend to move within the environment. Depending on the data being gathered, the raw data can be enough for a development team to make conclusions about their game and take that knowledge further into development. Other data is best represented visually, or studied closer. Therefore, I want to also include data visualization tools built into unity, such as creating heatmaps within the engine itself, and I want to allow the user to also conduct data analytics to make definite conclusions through significant figures. This would allow developers to run studies through QA builds that have slight changes to them, and through analysing specific data about what the study is focusing on, the system will return a P-value and indicate whether the test conducted was significant or not.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for this topic of interest is because I enjoy making tools to assist in project development, and have made some tools already for my capstone project Arachnotron. The team would like to go to as many QA sessions as possible, so it is my desire to create a tool that will allow the team to get the most out of each QA session to inform possible changes in design. The main challenge of this project will be keeping the interface easy to use and mostly visual with some code
